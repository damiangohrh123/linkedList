Creating linkedList  

UPDATE:  
Watched a youtube tutorial on linkedList in the beginning.  
Was able to do the rest of the code myself. (printSize, printListData, printHead, printTail, pop, contains, find, removeAt, toString)  
Overall fun project. Interested to learn more about data structures.  
Will try to use node and Jest to test out code instead of using browse console next time.
